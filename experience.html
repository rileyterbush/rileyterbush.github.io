        <h2>
            Ballet Club Officer -- 2023-2024
        </h2>

        <p>
            This year, I am the president of Purdue's ballet club. In the past I have been the vice president and treasurer. 
            Stepping up to the president role has brought on new responsibilities like managing relations with faculty, planning
            for grants and budgeting for the semester's events, being the primary point of contact for the club, and trying to expand
            the club. As the main teacher of the club, I also plan classes and teach technique from the ground up to adult students.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Ballet TA -- Fall 2024
        </h2>

        <p>
            In the fall of 2024, my instructor asked me to be a teaching assistant for the ballet class at Purdue University,
            which entails teaching combinations, filling in for the professor when he is absent, and helping to test out 
            and make combinations.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Ballet Instructor -- 2023
        </h2>

        <p>
            In the fall of 2023, I worked as a part-time ballet instructor at Young Women's Christian Association in Lafayette,
            and I planned and taught two different classes for middle school to high school aged children.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Dance Camp Instructor -- Summer 2023
        </h2>

        <p>
            In 2023, I worked with children ages 3 to 5 as an instructional assistant, responsible for demonstrating and taking care of 
            the students' needs.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Newspaper Editor -- 2021-2022
        </h2>

        <p>
            On my high school newspaper, I was a design editor and a managing editor. This involved creating my own extensive graphics on
            a print deadline. My work won awards on a state and national level, including a <a href="graphic-design.html#vaccine">first place</a>
            in the Graphics/Photo Illustration category in the National Federation of Press Women's 2021 high school newspaper contest and 
            <a href="graphic-design.html#martial">fifth place</a> in the National Scholastic 
            Press Association's 2021 Design of the Year competition.
